        <p>Login to get started. Once logged in, you can view the departments that you are registered to.
            If you aren't registered to any departments yet, contact your manager and they will add you.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can create your own Departments for teams that may pop up over your time here at Boogle.
            When you create a team, you will be able to add members via their email addresses. After you add
            everyone, you will see a link to edit the permissions for your new department. You can always
            edit the permissions by going back to the Meetings list for the department.
        </p>

        <p>
            With Meeting Knowledge Center, you can keep track of all the information your team might need by
            scheduling meetings, which creates a page that you (or your team members) can edit as necessary.
        </p>
